this was done in a separate project / repo but im going to put it here to consolidate everything. so things might not be structured or named very well, etc:

the data in the data and data_asa folders is the same data as in root/data/...

this was done for the equivelent of asa exp2 and nhanes exp 3 ONLY.

so the results of this method are meant to be checked against those two methods

The following two python scripts actually do the embedding, get top5 and then prompt an LLM to pick the best match:
main2.py -> corresponds to asa24 experiment 2
main3.py -> corresponds to nhanes experiment 3

these scripts take the 'pickled' results and give you accuracy score, aswell as create a csv file "[dataset]_joined_predictions.csv"
main2_evaluate.py -> creates the csv we will use to later, csv ends up in respective experiment
main3_evaluate.py -> creates the csv we will use to later, csv ends up in respective experiment

basically just depickle and map to original dataset
