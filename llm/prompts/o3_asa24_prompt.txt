You will receive two CSV files:

1. `input.csv`: This file has one column named `input_desc`. Each row contains a food description that needs to be matched.
2. `target.csv`: This file has one column named `unique_target_desc`, containing unique food descriptions that are shuffled.

Your task is to reason through each match and assign exactly one best matching target from `target.csv` to each input in `input.csv`. Use only logic, common sense, and language understanding.

Do NOT write or describe any code.
Do NOT explain your reasoning.
Only return the result as a single downloadable `.json` file with the following format:

[
  {
    "input_desc": "<input description here>",
    "predicted_target": "<best matching target description here>"
  },
  ...
]

Do NOT split the response into parts. Do NOT print the JSON inline. Only return a downloadable `.json` file containing the full result.
