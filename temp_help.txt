For 2 of the experiments a classification step is needed to also access accuracy. So two different prompts are used, when we use an LLM to find mappings.

The exact files that were sent to LLM are located in data/llm/{experiment_title}
- input_desc_list.csv
- target_desc_list.csv

output files are found in that same directory and are called "o3_predictions.json"
