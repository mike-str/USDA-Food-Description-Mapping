You will receive two CSV files:

1. `input_desc_list.csv`: This file has one column named `input_desc`. Each row contains a food description.
2. `target_desc_list.csv`: This file has one column named `unique_target_desc`, containing unique food descriptions that are shuffled.

Your task is to reason through each food description in `input_desc_list.csv` and assign exactly one best matching food description from `target_desc_list.csv`. Use only logic, common sense, and language understanding.

Do NOT write or describe any code.
Do NOT explain your reasoning.
Include only matches for food descriptions that exist in the input_desc column.
Return the result as tab-delimited text file in the following format:

<input_desc food description>	<unique_target_desc food description>
