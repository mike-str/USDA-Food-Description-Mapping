You will receive two CSV files:

1. `input_desc_list.csv`: This file has one column named `input_desc`. Each row contains a food description.
2. `unique_target.csv`: This file has one column named `unique_target_desc`, containing unique food descriptions that are shuffled.

Your task is to reason through each food description in `input_desc_list.csv` and assign exactly one best matching food description from `unique_target.csv`. Use only logic, common sense, and language understanding.

Do NOT write or describe any code.
Do NOT explain your reasoning.
Only return the result as a single downloadable tab-delimited text file with the following format:

<input_desc food description>	<unique_target_desc food description>
